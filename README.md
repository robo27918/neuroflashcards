## Notes

I used two components,CardDeck and FlipCard, to make my life easier. FlipCard was used to store data pertaining to one
particular card. CardDeck was used to render the entire deck of cards. In the future I want to allow anyone 
that visits the site to easily add more flash cards. I plan on placing a hamburger menu on the left and allowing 
the user to navigate to another Link where the can add additonal cards. I plan on using React-router to do this.
